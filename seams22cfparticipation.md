## Call for Participation 
 ### SEAMS 2022: The 17th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems
https://conf.researchr.org/home/seams-2022

Co-located with ICSE 2022, https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022

**May 18-20: Virtual Technical Program**

**May 23: In-Person Program, Pittsburgh, PA, USA**

## Why to participate?

Many of today's software-intensive systems need to continuously preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource

variability, evolving user needs, attacks, and faults. In addition to that, the complexity of these systems demands autonomy, self-management, and self-adaptation. SEAMS focuses on applying software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection.

SEAMS brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government, to investigate, discuss, examine and advance the fundamental principles, the state of the art, and the solutions addressing critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems.

SEAMS 2022 will have a virtual component, an in-person component, plus vibrant keynotes, a community discussion, and a doctoral track.

## Industrial Challenge Problem Design (In-Person)

Working with colleagues from a local Pittsburgh company, the half-day in-person event on May 23 is going to be devoted to the definition of an industrial challenge, with direct industrial relevance, that can be addressed by researchers.


## COVID-19 Statement
With such an international audience, we want everyone to feel safe. A number of prospective participants have expressed concerns about attending in person. To encourage as many people to attend as possible, all in-person participants will be required to show proof of vaccination and to wear masks during the conference. During meals and receptions, especially those held outdoors, masking requirements will be relaxed appropriately.
